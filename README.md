# plg_content_imgresponsive
Joomla 3.x plugin to add a responsive class to images

 This plugin will change all instances of 
 <img
 to 
 <img class="img responsive"
 so that Twitter Bootstrap v3 will auto resize all images in the content.
 
 Note that this is just a workaround and that it is better to optimize your images to the right sizes.
